# Scroll Progress Bar

You can find the script at `progress.js`, which creates a progress bar, places it at top of HTML document and fill's it up by how much of document has been read / viewed so far.

## Setup 

I've loaded the script in `index.html` for demostration purpose, which is one line : 

```
<script defer src="/progress.js" />
```
